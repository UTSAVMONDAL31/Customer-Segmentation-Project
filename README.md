# Customer-Segmentation-Project
A Customer Segmentation Project which segments supermarket customers using K-Means clustering. Data includes customer ID, age, gender, income, and a store-defined spending score. By analyzing these characteristics, we can group customers with similar shopping habits. This will help personalize promotions, optimize product placement, and target high-value segments for increased customer loyalty and revenue.
